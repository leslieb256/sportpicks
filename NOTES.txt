BOOTSTRAP
=========
How to tlayout columsn in Bootstrap: http://scotch.io/bar-talk/understanding-the-bootstrap-3-grid-system

WORKING ON
==========
*   Chart data should be sorted alphabetically by first character of diplayname. Bes tplace to do this would be before passing back from Chart Data creattion, ie: beofre the JSONifity

    
TODO - SHORT TERM
=================

* update fixture thing should work out score difference, winner and home/away pts by itself (will need seperate ones for Super15 and Aleague though), note Super15 will still need points added manually as 
they get bonus points for# of tries.

Round chart data should be based on the date of the last fixture (lastFixtureClosing Date)

Add 'sport' to league and event and comp. Sport data type will let me do some stuff eg: toprunscorere and topgoalscorere etc might need to do the seperately for each comp.
But the idea is the port type can limit what scoring option are avaailbae, soprt should record relevent scoring optns.


* need to work out why async does not seem to wotk on the rankling aprt (ie: I have to run it three times to get rankings to work to the comp ranking) - my application of async was bad, need to use callbacks see the submit pciks for example


see scoring.js for valid scoring options


APP NOTES
===================
for consistency sake we have messages based  bootstrap:
successMsg
infoMsg
warningMsg
dangerMsg

Large logos are 512x512, small are 128x128


A League
=========
Results: http://www.a-league.com.au/results/214/2014/0/4


SUPER15
========
http://www.superxv.com/fixtures/ - note: 4 ppints for win, 0 for loss, 2 for draw, 1 pt if you lose within 7 points and 1 point if you win by more than 4 tries
http://superrugby.com/co.nz for the offical site - use this data.



TODO LONG TERM
=======================

* colours for badges showi pnts etc, maybe should be blue for information and grey if currnely unscored or somrthing?

*   disaply with a red tiangle excl. rounds where pciks have not been coimpleted and comps where picks are closing and not completed.

*   Should create statistics by compeition on % of people that selected the various results, should maybe have the points table?, %age of people that picked the correct margin?

*   Competition model needs a closing date, probably the date of the last fixture in the event.

*   Need to add a awy to only bring through relevent teams, might happen if I start tracking teams and players linked to certain events. probably the best way is to add an event[] to the team or a team [] to the event.Need

*   Need to make the system validate pick update based on date before doing the update.

*   Closing date should be set in the compeition as being by round or by fixture. closeDate should be settable eg: closingRules: {by: round, time: -1 (hrs)}

*   Use the layout instructions to create a nested layyout like this:

    1   |   2   |   3   |   4   |   5   |   6   |   7
       
    logo    team    score   v/-   score   team    logo
            name                          name

    OR something more like the results table on the a league results page
    logo TEAM1   SCORE
    logo TESM2  SCORE
            
*   Work out how to remove the two test compeitions (ie: delete all fixture picks by comp, then edelete all the rounds by comp etc)

* also need to be able to delete all data relating to a user (eg: the test user).

*   Should have ALL fixtures listed in a table with competition and date. OR somthing like that. The people can sort the list by date and it can show cloed rounds/fixtures ealiy as all data will be there.

*    when users are added it should take the first part of the email address and make that the display name by default. The user should also be able to change displayname at anytime.

*   should page scrape results or have a decent results entry screen

* on th epicks screen need to be able to speciy in competiton or event whether a draw can be selected as some comeption types may not be able to draw (eg: world cup)

* e or 1hr before each round. Will also need to change how/when it updates the
"closed" status and warning on the round/fixtures. The closing date for rounds is hardcoded to hourn, needs to pull this from a variable at some stage.

* Make the list of rounds a table of links, later can make it sortable or something.

* Add round type:'fixture' and lastFixtureDates(?) to Aleague rounds for 2014/15 - this may be a compatability issue later. Type is to differentiate between rounds and bonus rounds etc, maybe finals as well?

* summry of round and picks for people to print and take home.

* do work on bouns round for picking overall comp winner.

* set redirect so that people can log in and it takes you to the relevent page automtically.

* should check if user is registered in a compeitiotn that is linked to the event/fixture before accepting pick

* Next round/previous round buttons on the round page.

*   shoudl email users last tune results and that picks are due.

* use sendgrid free plan to send emails?

* use HTML5 "required" on forms. There might be some oterh cool html 5stuff. eg: drop down elect lists to use as well.

* see the scoring for getting points history data on a better way to do the sorting in one line rather than an external function call.
