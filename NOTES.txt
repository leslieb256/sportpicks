WORKING ON
==========



TODO - SHORT TERM
=================

* make compeition for super Rugby super 15 + rounds + etc and find out who wants to play. DO NOT LOAD ANY PICKS AT THIS STAGE AS I NEED TO WORK OUT WHAT MARINGS TO USE.

* see stpehen about what marings to use 0,12,13+? or something different? How many points for each, 1 for the win 1 for the margin?

* need to work out why async does not seem to wotk on the rankling aprt (ie: I have to run it three times to get rankings to work to the comp ranking) - my application of async was bad, need to use callbacks see the submit pciks for example

* shuld have the event name in the lable/badge feidl in the competitoins page.



see scoring.js for valid scoring options



for consistency sake we have messages based  bootstrap:
successMsg
infoMsg
warningMsg
dangerMsg

Large logos are 512x512, small are 128x128

http://www.theroar.com.au/football/a-league/fixtures/
Results: http://www.a-league.com.au/results/214/2014/0/4

currently set so that fixture closes 1 hour before the first game of aroudn. later change to be set to either 12 hor before each fixtur


SUPER15
========
http://www.superxv.com/fixtures/
http://superrugby.com/co.nz for the offical site - use this data.

Set up super 15 for 2015 games. They srtat in Feb. Should be able to show Mat what the game tracker looks like during the A league.

Score margins are 0,1-12 and 13+


TODO LONG TERM
=======================

* colours for badges showi pnts etc, maybe should be blue for information and grey if currnely unscored or somrthing?

*   disaply with a red tiangle excl. rounds where pciks have not been coimpleted and comps where picks are closing and not completed.

*   add a "lastFixtureDate" to rounds schema to use for deciding when rounds should show the points.

*   make the sportpicks landing page a little more interesting, backgroun banner picture or something? Or a list of running events etc.

*   Should create statistics by compeition on % of people that selected the various results, should maybe have the points table?

*   Should create graphs of how you are doing. Also, when scoring ficture/round and comp should calc mean, media and mode scores to compaare the player with. At minimum should show each player against median and current leader
    Chart.js dimple.js? chart looks like the easiest option.

*   Competition model needs a closing date, probably the date of the last fixture in the event.

*   Need to add a awy to only bring through relevent teams, might happen if I start tracking teams and players linked to certain events. probably the best way is to add an event[] to the team or a team [] to the event.Need
*   Need to change pick loaded message to be a green background rathe than red, manybe make pass a 'picks ok' if the message is x. Also should feedback the pick in the ok message.
*   Need to make the system validate pick update based on date before doing the update.

*   Closing date should be set in the compeition as being by round or by fixture. closeDate should be settable eg: closingRules: {by: round, time: -1 (hrs)}

*   Use the layout instructions to create a nested layyout like this:

    1   |   2   |   3   |   4   |   5   |   6   |   7
       
    logo    team    score   v/-   score   team    logo
            name                          name

    OR something more like the results table on the results page
    logo TEAM1   SCORE
    logo TESM2  SCORE
            
*   Work out how to remove the two test compeitions (ie: delete all fixture picks by comp, then edelete all the rounds by comp etc)

*   Should have ALL fixtures listed in a table with competition and date. OR somthing like that. The people can sort the list by date and it can show cloed rounds/fixtures ealiy as all data will be there.

*    when users are added it should take the first part of the email address and make that the display name by default. The user should also be able to change displayname at anytime.

*   shoudl email users last tune results and that picks are due.

*   should page scrape results or have a decent results entry screen


* on th epicks screen need to be able to speciy in competiton or event whether a draw can be selected as some comeption types may not be able to draw (eg: world cup)

* e or 1hr before each round. Will also need to change how/when it updates the
"closed" status and warning on the round/fixtures. The closing date for rounds is hardcoded to hourn, needs to pull this from a variable at some stage.

* Make the list of rounds a table of links, later can make it sortable or something.

* need to link teams to compeitions, either team needs a list of comps or comps needs a list of teams, probably comp having list of teams seems logical this will limit teams returned when getting logos etc.
NOT SO IMPORTANT AT THIS STAGE AS IT ONLY APPLIES TO FIXUTRES AND THEY JUST POPULATE THE TEAMS IN THE ROUND SO ARE FILTERED ALRADY, WILL NEED TO TO DO FOR STUFF LIKE OVERALL WINNER ETC.

* Add round type: and lastFixtureDates(?) to Aleague rounds for 2014/15 - this may be a compatability issue later. Type is to differentiate between rounds and bonus rounds etc, maybe finals as well?


If I want to do multiple bonus rounds that is doable (for example winner of a stage or quarter) they can go in as bonus
