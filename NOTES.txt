WORKING ON
==========

DONE * standardise on fixture: date and round: last fixture date and firstFixtureDate
DONE * fix backend code refernce fixture.date and round.lastFixtureDate, round.firstfixtureDate (which is the old CloseDate) (routes file, not any of the admin files)
DONE * fix frontend code to fixture.date and round.lastFixtureDate and round.firstfixtureDate (which is the old CloseDate)
DONE * set round.closeDate and fixture.closeDate to undefined in testing
DONE * test
* close branch
* roll out to production (push out code THEN update production db)
* set round.closeDate and fixture.closeDate to undefined in production
* test production


* find out why elimiation finals are not appearing in Aleague!

* go back to working on selection by fixtures. (make new branch etc)



* set closeby and closebyhours on all current competitions (need to do this for ACTUAL DB as well).
* redesign the code to use the compeitition details for setting the round closing information
* THEN go back and start working on the fixture thing.
* copy closevy to last fixture date in round
* copy closedate to date in fixture (and vice cersa) later work out which one to use.

*   Should have ALL fixtures listed in a table with competition and date. OR somthing like that. The people can sort the list by date and it can show cloed rounds/fixtures ealiy as all data will be there.
* Make the list of rounds a table of links, later can make it sortable or something.

*   Closing date should be set in the compeition as being by round or by fixture. closeDate should be settable eg: closingRules: {by: round, time: -1 (hrs)}
* e or 1hr before each round. Will also need to change how/when it updates the
"closed" status and warning on the round/fixtures. The closing date for rounds is hardcoded to hourn, needs to pull this from a variable at some stage.
* Rounds closing within 2 weeks should be in a "closing soon" thing on the top of the page (later this shuld be settable in competiion options)
The comp screen should go to a screen with all matches - closing soon at top and the a list with headings for each 'round' (which are the pool names).

* load points scoring for RWC

* remvove modules from git

* learn promises https://promise-nuggets.github.io/articles/01-the-simplest-example.html , looks more useful than butcherig async about.

* when I change teams it should change any picks on that fixture who had selected the old teams to the new home/away temas.


TODO - SHORT TERM
=================


* actually whether it closes by fixture or round should be set in the event. Where it closes by round keep as is. Where it closes by fixture need to 
    use the fixture close data but also display grouped by round. for example for RWC this means that it will show as:
    ROUND1
        fix1
        fix 2
    ROUND2
        fix 3
        fix 4
    etc..
    with a closing soon bit at the top of all closnig soon fixtures.


* bonuspoints for selecting grand final winner for event
* event should store which teams are relevent for the event.
* Need to add a awy to only bring through relevent teams, might happen if I start tracking teams and players linked to certain events. probably the best way is to add an event[] to the team or a team [] to the event.Need
* the fact a bonus round is being used needs to be recorded in the comp, Along with the relvent ficutres maybe bonusPoints:{roundid{[fixtureID]}}} or something like that. If null then no bounspoints?

SHould have background image in div that stretches across sceen and then have a ligh greay transparent background with black text in ti for the Sport picks title in it. Maybe ajumbotron in a jumbotron?

* do regualr backups of the mongo database c:\prgram files\mongodb\bin\backup.bat


see scoring.js for valid scoring options

TODO LONG TERM
=======================

* work out better way to add player half way through and how to update the hisotrical socirng for that competition to include the new player. Basically iy needs to rerun scoring for all fixturesrounds before the person was added.

* rather than having a vague thing about whne a fixture or round is finalised maybe just have a boolean that says it is updated anc ranks caledc? routes.js roundsSatusDisplay woudl benegit from this

* use HTML5 "required" on forms. There might be some oterh cool html 5stuff. eg: drop down elect lists to use as well.
    http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_attributes.asp

*   Need to make the system validate pick update based on date before doing the update. Alos should check the date!
* should check if user is registered in a compeitiotn that is linked to the event/fixture before accepting pick

*Add 'sport' to league and event and comp. Sport data type will let me do some stuff eg: toprunscorere and topgoalscorere etc might need to do the seperately for each comp.
But the idea is the port type can limit what scoring option are avaailbae, soprt should record relevent scoring optns.

*   Use the layout instructions to create a nested layyout like this:

    1   |   2   |   3   |   4   |   5   |   6   |   7
       
    logo    team    score   v/-   score   team    logo
            name                          name

    OR something more like the results table on the a league results page
    logo TEAM1   SCORE
    logo TESM2  SCORE
            
*   Work out how to remove the two test compeitions (ie: delete all fixture picks by comp, then edelete all the rounds by comp etc)

* also need to be able to delete all data relating to a user (eg: the test user). OR at least make user login "inactive"

*    when users are added it should take the first part of the email address and make that the display name by default. The user should also be able to change displayname at anytime.

* on th epicks screen need to be able to speciy in competiton or event whether a draw can be selected as some comeption types may not be able to draw (eg: world cup)

* Next round/previous round buttons on the round page.

*   shoudl email users last tune results and that picks are due.
* use sendgrid free plan to send emails?
* use mailchimp? use Mandrill?

* see the scoring for getting points history data on a better way to do the sorting in one line rather than an external function call.

* you could add groups of users so that they can have an average or total score to compare to the other group to see who is best.

* add data for 2013/14 algeaue and 2014 suerr rugby for historical stats later

* work out why the graph does not work pepery in IE, it draw it way too big, Tried making the graph only load after the rest of the pages and this did not help.

* for stats need to do "if winner required, if not erquired for score difference and exact result as it will change the graphs since they currently assume winner is required.).

* team stats should be last 5 games results and last 5 games gainst this team results with a note for Home/awaty (use differnt colours for home and wawy)

* competition option to have random picks if person misses a fixture, should be marked as RANDOM and highlighted/noted in some way

* ediing fixtures how to get a handle on the date, might need a drop down showing the possible timezxones the date could be entered as at.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
======================
You can define environment variables in ~/.profile. Files outside of the workspace directory /home/ubuntu/workspace are not accessible for read only users. You can do e.g.

$ export SECRET=geheim
$ echo "export SECRET=geheim" >> ~/.profile

to define the variable SECRET and then use it through process.env.SECRET from your application. On the restart the varaibles should be set automatically.
