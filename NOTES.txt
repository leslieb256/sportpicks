Change fixtures and fixture to get the compeition data so as to include comp Name like the rounds page.
Change fixture to show round name instead of "Fixtures"
Change fixtures screen to show the round rankings
Change fixtures screen to show the points for each fixture as the batdge once the round has been scored.
Change fixture heading to show x v y and also to show names rather than "home" and "away" in the score selection for exact score.

Enter round 3+
Create scoring script ready for testing once done (for winner)
Create scoring script ready for testing once done (for exect score)
create ranking script for testing once scoring done.

Winner gets 1 pint, eaxt get 1 point. Make it completex is: winner can be any nominated points. exact score is with or without winner AND is x points - y points for each point off until zero).
Good ting about exect score over score difference is that it gives draw people someonthing to play for.

Closing date for fixtures should be beased on the round closing date ie: needs to populate (or get the rounds for a lookup) and use the closing date for the round.


for consistency sake we have messages based  bootstrap:
successMsg
infoMsg
warningMsg
dangerMsg

http://www.theroar.com.au/football/a-league/fixtures/

currently set so that fixture closes 1 hour before the first game of aroudn. later change to be set to either 12 hor before each fixture or 1hr before each round. Will also need to change how/when it updates the
"closed" status and warning on the round/fixtures. The closing date for rounds is hardcoded to hourn, needs to pull this from a variable at some stage.

Set up super 15 for 2015 games. They srtat in Feb. Should be able to show Mat what the game tracker looks like during the A league.

=======================
TODO:
Competition model needs a closing date, probably the date of the last fixture in the event.

Need to add a awy to only bring through relevent teams, might happen if I start tracking teams and players linked to certain events. probably the best way is to add an event[] to the team or a team [] to the event.Need
Need to change pick loaded message to be a green background rathe than red, manybe make pass a 'picks ok' if the message is x. Also should feedback the pick in the ok message.
Need to make the system validate pick update based on date before doing the update.

Closing date should be set in the compeition as being by round or by fixture. closeDate should be settable eg: closingRules: {by: round, time: -1 (hrs)}
