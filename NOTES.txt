WORKING ON
==========
* colours for badges showi pnts etc, maybe should be blue for information and grey if currnely unscored or somrthing?
*   disaply with a red tiangle excl. rounds where pciks have not been coimpleted and comps where picks are closing and not completed.
*  Rounds shold store how many fixtures are in them
*  Bonus rounds, since they re optioanl per comp need something like Competition.bonuspoints.[{roundID, fixutreID, no of fixutres}] to prpery ID when pciks are due and fixtures are missing - unpicked
*  Rounds closing soon or RUOnds with fixtures closing soon shuold be copied to a special section at the top of the Rounds page.
* rounds model now has a number of fixtures item, compare with the numbver of fixture pixks for that round and you know whether they have got them all
*   need to come up with a goo d tree for the badege/lable eg: if scored the score - infor, else if not scored and closed then badge with grey -, if not scored and closing in a week but has picks etc...

Pseudo tests:

if Round closed (round close date passed)
    scoring not completed (scoring just not done, check if there is a points record for the round if none)
        YELLOW badge with "-"
    scoring not completed (not all fixtures compelte, check if any fixtures have a closedate past current date)
        YELLOW badge with user score so far
        (there may be a points record but round not complete)
    else (all fixtures compelted and points calculated)
        DEFAULT badge with points
if Round open
    all picks done (picks count for round = round.fixtures)
        GREEN tick with closing date
    not all picks done
        closing within 1 week 
            Warning triangel RED round label with closing date
        closing within
            DEFAULT badge with closing date
            
Use tooltips on the yellow ones to explain what it means (http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tooltips)
Can test by just looking at teh round query and taking it to insert data in to a new function and see what comes uout. Ideally just adding relvent html to the object would be good.


TODO - SHORT TERM
=================

* Rounds closing within 2 weeks should be in a "closing soon" thing on the top of the page (later this shuld be settable in competiion options)

* summry of round and picks for people to print and take home.

* bonuspoints for selecting grand final winner for event
* event should store which teams are relevent for the event.
*   Need to add a awy to only bring through relevent teams, might happen if I start tracking teams and players linked to certain events. probably the best way is to add an event[] to the team or a team [] to the event.Need
* the fact a bonus round is being used needs to be recorded in the comp, Along with the relvent ficutres maybe bonusPoints:{roundid{[fixtureID]}}} or something like that. If null then no bounspoints?

* set redirect so that people can log in and it takes you to the relevent page automtically.

* do regualr backups of the mongo database c:\prgram files\mongodb\bin\backup.bat


see scoring.js for valid scoring options

TODO LONG TERM
=======================

* rather than having a vague thing about whne a fixture or round is finalised maybe just have a boolean that says it is updated anc ranks caledc? routes.js roundsSatusDisplay woudl benegit from this

* Rounds closing within 2 weeks should be in a "closing soon" thing on the top of the page (later this shuld be settable in competiion options)

* use HTML5 "required" on forms. There might be some oterh cool html 5stuff. eg: drop down elect lists to use as well.

*   Need to make the system validate pick update based on date before doing the update.
* should check if user is registered in a compeitiotn that is linked to the event/fixture before accepting pick

*   Should create statistics by compeition on % of people that selected the various results, should maybe have the points table?, %age of people that picked the correct margin?


*Add 'sport' to league and event and comp. Sport data type will let me do some stuff eg: toprunscorere and topgoalscorere etc might need to do the seperately for each comp.
But the idea is the port type can limit what scoring option are avaailbae, soprt should record relevent scoring optns.


*   Closing date should be set in the compeition as being by round or by fixture. closeDate should be settable eg: closingRules: {by: round, time: -1 (hrs)}
* e or 1hr before each round. Will also need to change how/when it updates the
"closed" status and warning on the round/fixtures. The closing date for rounds is hardcoded to hourn, needs to pull this from a variable at some stage.


*   Use the layout instructions to create a nested layyout like this:

    1   |   2   |   3   |   4   |   5   |   6   |   7
       
    logo    team    score   v/-   score   team    logo
            name                          name

    OR something more like the results table on the a league results page
    logo TEAM1   SCORE
    logo TESM2  SCORE
            
*   Work out how to remove the two test compeitions (ie: delete all fixture picks by comp, then edelete all the rounds by comp etc)

* also need to be able to delete all data relating to a user (eg: the test user). OR at least make user login "inactive"

*   Should have ALL fixtures listed in a table with competition and date. OR somthing like that. The people can sort the list by date and it can show cloed rounds/fixtures ealiy as all data will be there.
* Make the list of rounds a table of links, later can make it sortable or something.

*    when users are added it should take the first part of the email address and make that the display name by default. The user should also be able to change displayname at anytime.

*   should page scrape results or have a decent results entry screen

* on th epicks screen need to be able to speciy in competiton or event whether a draw can be selected as some comeption types may not be able to draw (eg: world cup)

* Next round/previous round buttons on the round page.

*   shoudl email users last tune results and that picks are due.
* use sendgrid free plan to send emails?

* see the scoring for getting points history data on a better way to do the sorting in one line rather than an external function call.

* you could add groups of users so that they can have an average or total score to compare to the other group to see who is best.

* add data for 2013/14 algeaue and 2014 suerr rugby for historical stats later

* work out why the graph does not work pepery in IE, it draw it way too big, Tried making the graph only load after the rest of the pages and this did not help.
