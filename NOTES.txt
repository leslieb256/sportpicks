BOOTSTRAP
=========
How to tlayout columsn in Bootstrap: http://scotch.io/bar-talk/understanding-the-bootstrap-3-grid-system

WORKING ON
==========

*   Create displaynames for users which are shown instead of things


TODO - SHORT TERM
=================

*   remove sign up

*   add the login to the first page.

*   Enter round 5+

*   Change fixture heading to show x v y and also to show names rather than "home" and "away" in the score selection for exact score.
    Round 1 should sayd Fixtures:Round 1
    Competition should say something like this as well.
    
*   add and test having scoring option of scoreDifference (use one of the test comps)
    

see scoring.js for valid scoring options



for consistency sake we have messages based  bootstrap:
successMsg
infoMsg
warningMsg
dangerMsg

http://www.theroar.com.au/football/a-league/fixtures/

currently set so that fixture closes 1 hour before the first game of aroudn. later change to be set to either 12 hor before each fixture or 1hr before each round. Will also need to change how/when it updates the
"closed" status and warning on the round/fixtures. The closing date for rounds is hardcoded to hourn, needs to pull this from a variable at some stage.

Make the list of rounds a table of links, later can make it sortable or something.

for some reason fixtures are not in order on the pfixutres page. Need to have a look at this proaby to do with teh fact the JSOPN is not orderd so it us up to the browser how it pulls/cucles the data. Might need to make thgese lists.


SUPER15
========
http://www.superxv.com/fixtures/

Set up super 15 for 2015 games. They srtat in Feb. Should be able to show Mat what the game tracker looks like during the A league.


TODO LONG TERM
=======================

*   Should create statistics by compeition on % of people that selected the various results.

*   Should create graphs of how you are doing. Also, when scoring ficture/round and comp should calc mean, media and mode scores to compaare the player with. At minimum should show each player against median and current leader
    Chart.js dimple.js? chart looks like the easiest option.

*   Competition model needs a closing date, probably the date of the last fixture in the event.

*   Need to add a awy to only bring through relevent teams, might happen if I start tracking teams and players linked to certain events. probably the best way is to add an event[] to the team or a team [] to the event.Need
*   Need to change pick loaded message to be a green background rathe than red, manybe make pass a 'picks ok' if the message is x. Also should feedback the pick in the ok message.
*   Need to make the system validate pick update based on date before doing the update.

*   Closing date should be set in the compeition as being by round or by fixture. closeDate should be settable eg: closingRules: {by: round, time: -1 (hrs)}

*   Add team logos to the database/static file path and make it look prettier.

*   Use the layout instructions to create a nested layyout like this:

    1   |   2   |   3   |   4   |   5   |   6   |   7
       
    logo    team    score   v/-   score   team    logo
            name                          name
            
*   Work out how to remove the two test compeitions (ie: delete all fixture picks by comp, then edelete all the rounds by comp etc)

*   Should have ALL fixtures listed in a table with competition and date. OR somthing like that. The people can sort the list by date and it can show cloed rounds/fixtures ealiy as all data will be there.
